# MyCollege-3450-Project
For Professor

MyCollege is a cool and easy way for students to get to know their campus more and the host-spots it has to offer.  This application pulls from the pins that are uploaded from a university admin allowing the university to tell fun facts that other services like google maps wouldn’t know. When the application starts, you are asked to select your university. Once selected, the pins for that selected university are downloaded and you can view the pins by simple clicking on them. When viewing a pin, you will see the pins name, description, and a picture of the pins point of interest. This picture will change dependent of the current season that the user is in. This allows a fun way to view the place to reflect the current season. A user can also select a different university by selecting “other school” at the bottom.

Device Requirements:
